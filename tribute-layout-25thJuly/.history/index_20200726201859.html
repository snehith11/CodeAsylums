        Rishi Raj Kapoor (4 September 1952 – 30 April 2020) was an Indian
        actor known for his work in Bollywood. Born into the Kapoor
        family, he made his debut, as an adolescent, in his father Raj
        Kapoor's film Mera Naam Joker (1970), for which he won the National Film
        Award for Best Child Artist. As an adult, his first lead role was
        opposite Dimple Kapadia in the teen romance Bobby (1973), which won him
        the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Kapoor is considered to be one of the
        most successful actors in the history of Bollywood. Between 1973
        and 2000, Kapoor starred as the romantic lead in 92 films. Some of
        his notable films during this period include Khel Khel Mein (1975),
        Kabhi Kabhie (1976), Sargam (1979), Karz (1980), and Chandni (1989).
        Since the 2000s, he played character roles to critical acclaim in such
        films as Do Dooni Chaar (2010), Aurangzeb (2013), and Mulk
        (2018). For his performance in Do Dooni Chaar (2010), he won
        the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor, and for his role in Kapoor &
        Sons (2016), he won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. He
        was honoured with the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.
        His final film appearance was in The Body (2019). Kapoor often
        collaborated with his wife, actress Neetu Singh, with whom he had two
        children, including Ranbir Kapoor. He died of leukemia on 30 April 2020,
        aged 67.
